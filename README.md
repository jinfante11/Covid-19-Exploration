# Covid-19-Exploration

This project focuses on analysing the COVID-19 pandemic using a comprehensive dataset from Our World in Data. The analysis was performed using SQL for data processing and Tableau for visualisation.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**: Imported the COVID-19 deaths and Vaccinations tables with the correct data type for each column.
2. **Data Processing**: Processed data using aggregate functions, joins, and CTEs, and created views in SQL.
3. **Data Visualisation**: Created interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualise the analysis results.
